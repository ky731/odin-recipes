    <h3>Perfect Chicken Piccata - My family loves this recipe!</h3>
    <p>Briny capers and a tangy, fresh lemon sauce top tender pieces of breaded chicken in this easy, restaurant-quality recipe for chicken piccata. The sauce is so addicting, you'll want to drink it! Serve with pasta.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>And more shit I don't feet like listing - figure out the rest.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice chicken breasts in half lengthwise and lightly pound to 1/2-inch thick. Season evenly on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each piece in flour to coat the surface and shake off any excess flour.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Add 1/2 of the chicken and cook, undisturbed, until browned and easily released from the skillet, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from the skillet. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the drippings and repeat the cooking process with remaining chicken. Reserve all chicken on a plate.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to medium and melt remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Add wine and capers and stir, scraping to release any browned bits from the skillet; bring to a simmer. Cook for 2 minutes to slightly reduce. Add chicken stock, lemon juice, and lemon zest; stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>As for the rest... you're on your own. Good luck!</li>
    </ol>
