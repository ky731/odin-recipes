    <h3>Perfect Aussie Chicken - My family loves this recipe!</h3>
    <p>This recipe is very similar to a chicken dish served at a local well-known restaurant. A friend of mine was kind enough to share it. It includes chicken breasts topped with mushrooms, bacon and cheese cooked in a honey-mustard sauce.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons seasoning salt</li>
      <li>6 slices bacon, cut in half</li>
      <li>And more shit I don't feet like listing - figure out the rest.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning salt, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until crisp. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, honey, corn syrup, mayonnaise and dried onion flakes. Remove half of sauce, cover and refrigerate to serve later.</li>
      <li>As for the rest... you're on your own. Good luck!</li>
    </ol>
